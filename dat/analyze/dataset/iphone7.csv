After three months of trying, going to T Mobile stores in Vermont, Massachusetts and New York, it could never be activated for data use. It is basically, an I Pod. After reaching out to the company about it, they reassured me the phone was fine. It isn’t.

I looked up the problem on the internet and came to the conclusion it was the battery.  I took it to the local computer store and ordered a new battery.  The technician told me the protective plate that holds down the battery was missing and whoever refurbished this phone put a piece of tape inside the phone.  Also, it came with a screen protector on it.  The case I put on the phone won’t fit with this protector so I took it off.  The technician told me the screen was warped when he put the new battery in it.  I will never buy another refurbished phone!!!!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",1.0,What I liked about this phone is the price for $150 not too bad. But I just spent an additional $49 for insurance.

I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be.

When we first received the phone, we were annoyed to find that the front camera didn't work and the battery only lasted an hour or two before dying. After 4 months of owning the phone, it completely stopped working. Would not receive or make calls and couldn't send texts unless connected to wifi. We took to the Apple store and they said that this model was discontinued because of this issue, and there was nothing they could do. My husband ended up having to buy a completely new phone.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",1.0,Phone worked ok but the battery wouldn't last over 4 hours or less with use they must have forgotten to refurbished it.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",1.0,"The seller I bought from (Electronic Deals) sent me a phone with 69% battery health.  Even though the Amazon description clearly says 80% or above.  The health dropped to 68% the next day, and then wouldn't even hold a charge.  If they're not even simply checking if a number in the settings is above 80% (a simple yes or no), then you have to wonder if they're really inspecting these at all.  These phones are good prices and it's easy to return them, but still annoying for it to be sent without passing a simple inspection check and potentially leave people without a phone another few days while they return and wait for a new one.  I highly recommend everyone to check the battery health right when you receive the phone before you waste your time installing stuff/setting up."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",1.0,This is not the first renewed phone I have purchased from amazon and typically they are like brand new phones with less battery life but for some reason this particular phone I am having all kinds of problems.

This second phone has decent battery life but looks like complete and utter crap. The casing is scuffed and pitted everywhere and the screen is horribly scratched.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,Based on what a renewed phone should be I assumed at least if the battery performance was so awful it would be replaced. TI have to charge the phone 5-6 times a day which shouldn’t be the case with minimal use I don’t watch videos not on social media.

The only issue with the phone is that the battery doesn't last even half a day. This is without receiving phone calls or messages on the phone, this is just from receiving random notifications.  Once you start using any of the media apps on the phone (YouTube, Apple TV etc.), the phone's battery just does a nose dive.  The phone would have received a 5-star rating if it had a stronger performing battery that could last at least through an entire day.  The charger included with the purchase was very good, at least the seller included a fast charger (greatly needed for how quickly this battery dies)"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"It works. It dies fairly quickly and the speaker for private phone calls barely works. Sounds like it has water in in or something, but it’s solely for my 9 year old to be able to call me when he’s at his elderly grandparents, so I’m not worried about it."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I switched from Android to IPhone. Horrible decision. Every time it upgrades, which is often, the phone gets worse.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,Worked fine for about a month and then it started saying it needed to update but no update was available. Took it to get looked at and it can’t be fixed! Waste of money!

Because I was in a situation where I couldn’t wait for a return, I had to get the battery replaced at my expense.

If I wasn’t in a pinch I would have returned it in a heartbeat."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"The shipping was slow, and the phone that I received was not silver as advertised it came in white.

I bought it in April at the beginning of the pandemic with very limited choices to buy a phone and my old phone was not working.

Almost uses the entire battery life from one phone call terrible idea to buy used phones apparently.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,Phone turned out to be nice but the charger I received wasn’t compatible with this phone.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I’m returning this item as the battery from the get go did not last long at all. It would be at 50% after using it for an hour or two. It would also do weird things like be at 40%, then I’d turn it off and then back on and it would be at 80%. It sometimes will shut off when the battery is at 20%. The last thing it started doing was the touch screen doesn’t work sometimes and sometimes it scrolls or zooms in when I’m not even touching the screen at all. I’ve heard that can happen from having a battery that is expanding and it somehow effects the touchscreen."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I am extremely unhappy with this purchase. I live in and work in West Africa and I ordered this phone to my parents' home in the US so I could pick it up during the summer and bring it with me back to Africa. I wanted a reliable phone that I could take some nice photos with. I am constantly having problems with the mic and camera. The problems seem to be software issues as the mic and camera occasionally work, but that is rare and by no means reliable. Not having the ability to make and receive phone calls has been an extreme inconvenience for me and has put me in some bad situations.There is a return policy, but I cannot easily mail things here so I am simply stuck with an unreliable phone."

For the last month it has been getting worse and worse and of course I'm out of the 90 day warranty period. At first I thought maybe an update would fix it. NOPE. Maybe background apps are sucking my battery? Nope. hotspot usage? bluetooth? No. The battery just sucks. It gets down to about 30% and it dies. It dies suddenly and without apparent cause. Something happens around 30% to make it drain quickly to 0. It doesn't even warn me that the power is low. When I bought the iphone, the Max Capacity was 84%. Now it's 56%. gr."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,I thought a refurbished phone would have a new battery.  With only two very short calls the battery lost complete charge within 5 hours.  What a disappointment.  Won't do this again.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"This was a great phone and all, but once I got outside of the 90-day protection period I noticed a few problems coming gout of the woodwork. First the battery started not charging slower and with a little less time on a full battery, which I honestly thought would happen earlier on. However that hasn't been the only problem, now it makes a very loud sounds middle of calls and the in-call speaker randomly emits extremely loud burst of static, screechings, and whistles that have left my ear ringing and unable to finish calls. If its not making those sounds in my ear, it usually doesn't make any at all. My mic picks up my voice, but I can't hear anything, not even on speakerphone.This may have been a bad on out of the batch, but if you have money to buy something better I'd say to consider it. Unless you want to use it as an ""Ipod""."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"Phone won’t let me allow certain permissions on it. Camera is trash, and so is the battery life. Also, kind of a disappointment. It’s small. No storage space."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I purchased a refurbished , ""like new"" iPone 7 from a dealer for Amazon.  The Amazon guarantee clearly states that the battery level is 80% or higher.  The battery in my phone was at 69% and said on the phone that the battery was degrading the system and should be replaced.  I would have thought the dealer would have noticed this.  That was my immediate concern.  When I contacted the dealer they said they would provide $30 towards a new battery.  Since it costs at least three times that to replace it I had to send it back.  I thought the offer was useless, rather insulting, considering the phone didn't meet the guaranteed standards.  The iPone itself worked well.  My only problem with it was that it was too small.  I hadn't realized how much that smaller size effected visual ability.  I sent it back, obviously and will never deal with that seller again."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"It took courage to decide to buy a ""refurbished"" unit through Amazon.  This seller was rated high, but it became very apparent there was an issue which would have been identified by even a simple systems check.  The audio didn't work.  Neither the external microphone or connection of headphones via bluetooth or with a dongle.  I did receive a full refund but it took 3 weeks and the additional hassle of finding an alternative.  I would not recommend this seller.  Apparently not very thorough."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"3 months in and the battery was not lasting more than 1/2 a day. Was offered reimbursement to have the battery replaced at Best Buy or Apple. Both were closed due to Corona virus. Now 6 months later, noticed that the power/charging jack is really loose and the cables fall out if not set ""just right"". Tried OEM and other cables to no avail. Guess you always get what you pay for."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I bought this phone being very skeptical about it. I don't usually go for refurbished, but money was tight and I need ed something fast. Initially, the phone seemed great. Everything worked as it should and it seemed like I got a bang for my buck. However, about 2 months in, I noticed there were some issues with the device detecting my cellular network. I didn't give it too much thought, I just blamed it on the coverage being spotty. However, now, 4 months in, the phone is useless. It cannot be used on the cellular network as it never detects it. Lucky for me, this is just a month away from the return period. If you want a phone for a few months, I guess this is not bad. However, if you intend to keep this a bit longer and expect usual Apple quality, I recommend you stay away."

We reset the network numerous times and still ended up sending this back to Amazon. Great phone when it works properly."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,Battery is too poor and thus requests a replacement to see whether it is good. Replacement is still undergoing.~ battery life is only 3 hours~~and battery self-check by the phone is unhealthy in the battery system.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed."

Phone states it only has 74%battery life and the battery needs replacedOther than the battery draining super fast, the phone looked brand spanking new!Also T-Mobile said there must be something wrong with the phone.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I ordered a Verizon phone and got an AT&T phone. The phone was in perfect condition except for one tiny scratch in the screen, it came with a charger and cord as well as the metal pic to get the SIM card out.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"An iPhone battery that falls under 80% is best to be replaced through an authorized Apple location! This device along with many others sold that are “refurbished” come with a battery that’s less than 70%. Mine was at about 65%, if it was my primary device I would be livid! I needed a phone when my iPhone X stopped working and I would much rather have spent an extra $250 more for something newer. You can’t use this phone for anything without it needing to stay on the charger. Everything else works normally. As it states expect cosmetic damage. Nothing that has impact on functionality though. Ask for the battery capacity before you buy it. Anything over 75% should last at least 8 months/year before needing a battery replacement. Anything under will be an immediate  issue."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I bought one of these phones and within a few weeks it was no longer able to make or receive a phone call. I ended up contacting the seller who told me they didn’t have one for me to exchange with and that they would allow a refund. Looking on the website there was another one for me to get so I ended up biting the bullet and just bought another of the same phone thinking I just had bad luck. I ended up having to pay $20 to ship the old phone back but at least got my refund. The second phone I bought was more expensive by $20 than the first for the same exact phone, which is probably why the seller wouldn’t exchange and lied saying they didn’t have one. The second phone I got at least works and can make calls still, but the battery is 71% unlike the 80% minimum as promised. I’m not going to lose even more money to send this back so I’ll deal with the bad battery, but definitely would not recommend buying from this seller. I’ve bought two phones and had poor experiences both times."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,This phone was purchased a couple of months ago and went out right away.  We recovered it now it is totally out and Apple said on recall due to malfunction.  Trying to get it replaced.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,I should off get some of my money back
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I ordered an iPhone 7 for my mom as a quick replacement for her older iPhone that was no longer holding a charge. After emailing the seller about the shipping delays, the phone finally arrived. Upon inspection of the phone the first thing I noticed was a long scratch on the back of the phone. Not a big deal, it’s refurbished. The SIM card tray jutted out a bit and after looking online at images of iPhone 7’s, I figured out this wasn’t apart of the design, red flag but it didn’t affect the performance of the iPhone from what I could tell. The phone needed to be updated, once again no big deal. But for someone who wants a phone that’s ready to use, the update time might be an issue.Now I will get to my 2 star rating. As I’m setting up the phone for my mother, I noticed it was running really hot on the back upper part of the phone, opposite the camera. A software update and transferring data could cause this so I set the phone to the side to cool off a bit when I was done. Two days later and the phone barely keeps a charge. This problem with the old phone was the reason I bought this iPhone 7. Needless to say I will be returning this product. It could just be a defective one out of the bunch."

The phone immediately ran extra hot to the touch. I had a 7 before that did same thing bc something was wrong with it. Then screen wouldn’t touch properly- common issue with this model and why I got rid of my last 7. Returned it immediately and was refunded very quickly. Seems like a decent seller but needs better quality checks on refurbs.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I got this for my son on Christmas. It was in a strange box that was already flipped open with the iPhone just flying around in there. Came with an LG power brick and worn out lightning cable that didn't make it to New Year's. My son tells me that if he's lucky he'll get about 2 hours of life before it reaches 50%. It came at 80% maximum capacity battery health, the bare minimum for it to be considered ""certified refurbished"" even though there was a small crack and huge scratches on the screen! Whoever said that this is ""certified refurbished"" is a big liar. He has had it for about five months now. It works as if it's new, except for the battery life."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"The battery life on this phone is terrible. In the settings it says that the max life is 80%, but my last phone was 80% and lasted much longer. I have to charge the battery multiple times a day. I will start a run with 100% battery and at the end of the run, it will be at 10% or less. I’m very angry that this is what I paid for. Don’t buy."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"Physically the phone was very clean. No scratches or dings. Unfortunately the battery was poor. After fully charging it, it did not last long. I found myself having to charge it too often.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,The phone looks new and there's no scratches unlike other people comment but the thing is that when I charge the phone it's getting hot and the battery don't last. I just used it for like 10-15 mins and it's already half of the battery life and it's getting hotter and hotter when you used it. I returned it anyways coz I'm afraid that the phone might explode while I used it or I charge it. I'm soooo disappointed coz this is my first iphone and also this is the first time I ordered through online. Lesson learned but its a great experience though. I hope this will help those people who's thinking of buying a refurbished phone. My advise is that always rethink coz not everyone is lucky to get a good phone like the other says in the comment.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",2.0,"I bought two phones intending to give it to my kids as a gift. Phones took a Verizon SIM card with no problem, and I confirmed that they was able to make/receive calls.  One bonus was that they both came with screen protectors already on them.  What completely ruined both phones was the battery life.  I charged both phones to full and turned them off, intending to wrap these up. When I powered them on the next day, the battery percentage was at 21% on one, and 18% on the other. On the silver one, I noticed it was blinking an Apple logo on and off every minute or so.  Mind you, this was with both phones being powered OFF.  This is downright appalling, and if it does this when the phones are OFF, then it means that the battery life when the phones are being actively used is next to nil. This is not 1980. I am not buying corded phones.  I’m giving an extra star on this review for customer service, as the seller approved the return almost immediately, and issued the refund when the products were returned."

Then, I opened the battery settings and saw, in a big red font, ""Battery requires service."" I've scheduled an appointment to have the battery replaced, but the fact that I'm going to have to shell out an additional $50 on top of the phone's $150 price is negating any savings I might have realized by buying refurbished/ renewed. I will say, the seller has been responsive and helpful, and they even offered to share the cost of a new battery with me. All-in-all, once I get it to work, I'm sure it'll be fine.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The phone had some minor issues with functionality.  It may be because it was a pre-owned phone.  It would have been better if it had more of a battery life.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Battery life is insufficient and less than expected.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,This phone did not hold charge and is now not even turning on no matter how long you put it to charge. It shuts off. Only had it since April of 2020. I purchased another two one for my son and one for my daughter and hers is the one that won’t hold charge or do anything.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,UPDATE: This company did keep trying to send a different replacement. We’ve finally got a good phone. Thank you.Original review: The phone might be a good product but when buying used it’s a gamble. And it certainly has been the case buying from this company. It says Amazon certified but it’s a 3rd party company so who knows what they give you.  This is our second time returning a phone back to the them because they are in some way defective.  We are kind of left hanging on what to do next and we are still out of a phone. Again.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The phone works well, but a big problem is that the phone's lightening charging port is difficult to hold a cable.In other words, I have to hold the charging cable in order to charge my phone. If I let go of the charging cable, the cable comes loose. This is very inconvenient."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The battery health is at 85%.  I was hoping for closer to 90%.  Other than that it looks almost new.  very few shallow scratches on screen.  They can only be seen when the phone is off and at an angle.  There are a very few scratches on the back of the phone.  Seems to function normally.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The battery life isn’t that great and it glitches out and shuts down apps a lot. Not sure if that’s a phone issue or an update issue. It’s a decent phone but I expected a little more from it.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,After 6 months started having some issues with the phone. Factory reset it fixed the problem. Over the next month problem started getting worse. Ended up with phone saying no service or searching. Took it to apple they did a reset but did not fix the problem. Ended up having to buy a new phone. Really disappointed that I spent almost $200 on a phone that didn’t even last a year.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Exactly what I expected, and it arrived sooner than advertised. It did take two days to receive a response from their customer service / tech group about a volume issue. But that issue turned out to be an oversight on my part concerning plastic film on the phone.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Came with a strange app still on it (kinda sketchy). Should have gone with refurbished NOT ""renewed"". The battery needs to be replaced. I dont think its good practice to sell anything with a bad battery because the buyer will have a bad experience with the phone making it difficult to see any of the good qualities about the phone. ""Renewed"" as a description word should just be eliminated all together. Its wither refurbished or used! "" Renewed"" is misleading to someone who has bought refurbished before and been happy with the phone they received. Im not happy with this phones battery but I needed more storage so Im keeping it. I have to put more money into it because the battery stinks, and Im not happy about that."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,So far so good.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Cell is perfectly fine in appearance and operation and automatically worked on my Verizon plan after I installed my Verizon Sim card from my previous cell.  Specs said at least 80% battery, but found the 85% battery health  draining too fast even after battery-hog features disabled.  It’s refurbished and wondering why the battery wasn’t changed out even if it cost a tad more.Apple certified repair N/A in my area due to COVID-19 and did not want to chance non certified repair so I had to spring $49 + tax + $6 UPS for Apple send-away for a battery change plus 6 day turn around to ensure 100% battery health.

Phone also listed as compatible with Sprint sims but it’s not, it’s only T-Mobile and ATAT that are compatible, my SIM card comes from before the Sprint-T-Mobile merger so maybe that’s why.Edit: Phone is being shipped back and returned, battery capacity not as displayed in description and the carrier stated in the description was wrong it only works with GSM phones.

Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"A couple thoughts on this item. I received it a day early than expected so the shipping was great. It didn't come in an original iPhone box however it wasn't damaged in any way. The condition was perfect. I was pretty happy with it. Put in a Verizon sim and it picked up the Verizon network pretty much immediately. Then put it on charge to charge up and updated the operating system.This is when things went south. The battery ran super hot when charging. A lot more hot than normal. I then tried typing in the phone's IMEI number into Verizon's website and was told that the phone is not compatible with Verizon. I did this more than once just to make doubly sure I had typed it in correctly.I then tried to make a call. The call quality was terrible. At times it was impossible to hear anything. It didn't matter if the call was on speaker or not. I tried restarting the phone and got pretty much the same result. When trying to make a call, it spoke a lot about roaming. This was key. I turned the roaming option off and tried again. Still talking about roaming.This phone was not 100% unlocked. It was probably locked to a network such as AT&T or T-Mobile at some stage, however it lacks the antenna which will allow it to connect to other networks such as Verizon or Sprint. A phone which is 100% unlocked will have antenna built into it which support all the networks making it a fully unlocked phone. The phone did pick up Verizon, however that was based on roaming on some other network and not by connecting directly to any Verizon tower in my area.A fully unlocked phone would have shown on Verizon's website that the IMEI number was compatible with their network. It would have also come back as being compatible with AT&T's network as well as T-Mobile and Sprint. It would have saved me time and money if the IMEI number was checked by the seller as to whether it was compatible with the Verizon network instead of running an unlock code on the phone and then marketing it as being fully unlocked.I checked the IMEI number. It came back clean however it does show that it comes from a phone which has 128 GB of storage. This phone has 32 GB of storage, so somewhere there is a discrepancy. I suspect the phone may have been made up from parts from various phones.I sent the phone back."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,I was a little disappointed with this phone.  I was not aware I would need to buy a sim card in order to fully activate the phone.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Good phone other than the home button is a bit lower than the screen making it difficult to absorb the heat contact needed to control the button.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,This phone was not unlocked as described. Verizon could not recognize the IMEI number and it could not be registered. It was returned.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The battery is so old, it doesn’t hold a charge for long and I’ll have to drive 2 hours to an Apple store to replace it. Even worse, the proximity detector doesn’t work, so I’m constantly touching things on the screen when I try to hold the phone up to my ear. It’s almost impossible. I have to use speaker phone to avoid that."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The phone came in much better quality than I thought it would. They got the color and storage right, and it was incredibly easy to transfer data from one phone to another, just like buying from Apple. The differences are that the charger and adapter are off brand and don't really work (easy fix: just buy another from absolutely anywhere), the screen came with a few 'scratches' (not deep or anything, just apparent marks when you look at it), some dead pixels in the middle of the screen and one ACTUAL scratch that makes me more nervous about the screen cracking. It doesn't come with a screen wipe or anything, but you can also get those easily. In the package is a little SIM card pick, which is especially helpful and something lots of people forget to throw in (Apple doesn't even send one). Overall, the phone is nice where it matters, but has small issues one can't help but notice."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Only needed this phone to use a specific app that neither my basic android nor my galaxy could handle for some reason. The price made it worth it for the brief amount of time I needed said app (90 days), otherwise I would have spent 3 or 4 times as much on a decent newer model Samsung. But beyond that and the storage space, iphones are horrible devices (nothing against apple, love my macbook pro). The love for them is indefensible, and only NPCs would even try."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Does not work as it should the screen shakes and the battery life is not so good
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Bought this iPhone to use on tracfone it works but can’t use the WiFi calling feature.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Phone worked well, no issues there.  They are not kidding about the battery capacity being at least 80%.  That's exactly what mine was.  This phone is for my son and the battery barely lasts 6 hours..  I've bought a new battery and a water tight seal and I will install myself.  Just letting people know they may need to spend an additional $35 for a new battery if they get a phone like a weak battery like mine.I struggled with the rating because this product is exactly what the seller said it would be.  Giving 3 stars so people might notice this review and know they will likely get a weak battery and have to take additional steps to replace it like me."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,This phone was sold to me with a battery that doesn’t charge all the way.  Servicing will cost substantially more money.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,I am annoyed because the battery life for this phone is just 80%. You guys should have replaced it before sending it. I have to keep changing the phone at least 3 to 4 time per day... ughhhhhhhhhhhhh
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,phone is cool for the first day. second day it rejects the cellular data and you no longer have service.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Everything was good except the battery condition. I now have to pay for a replacement battery.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Worked out of the box. Found it was hard to charge. Cleaned out the charging port with a toothpick and found a lot of pocket lint. Hmmmn. Not really a thorough refurbish, tho it gave me hope that the prior owner had dumped it on that issue. Battery life not great regardless.A month later it started giving a ‘no cellular service’ and I find on research that there is a documented factory flaw in one of the chips. By restarting the phone cell service can be restored, but an intermittent irritation. Took it into the Apple store and they found no issue, only recommended replacing the battery, which I had them do. Interestingly they charged the same as mr fixit in the strip mall. $50 gave me a phone with real battery life.The problem however continues to crop up about once a week. Apple said it was fine so they own the fix if it becomes chronic.For the price not a bad deal. Love the fingerprint entry feature."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,Phone works well now but had to take it to apple for them to update the phone because it didn’t accept my sim although stated “unlocked”. Once I took it to apple it accepted the sim immediately and worked great
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Phone was in fine working condition, was clean, bit of wear on the back but that is to be expected. The only downside is the charger cable and box it came with do not work at all. Tried it two different phones and it would not give a charge."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Condition of the phone was good when it showed up, and arrived quickly. However, description clearly stated it was compatible with SPRINT (CDMA) and the model that showed up was a GSM only. Had to switch to a different carrier to accommodate, which isn't the end of the world...but STILL. Annoying."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"I've bought two of these, but not for a good reason... the first one I got from a seller named BuySPRY and unfortunately it looks like they don't repair the phones they work on correctly. I didn't really take concern about this until after I spilled a glass of water on my table, some of which went onto the phone. These phones are rated IP67 water resistant, but this particular phone repaired by BuySPRY was not properly sealed.If you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one; this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details. Anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced, there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen - which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress.The big sad thing here is this happened I'm not kidding one day after the 90 warranty ended. I contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything. They didn't at all seem concerned their phone wasn't repaired correctly, nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device.So I ended up buying a new one, from a different seller named Hybrid IT. It has been over a month now and I so far have had a good experience. The first phone I got had a poor health battery as indicated in iPhone battery information. I contacted the seller about it; and they immediately corrected the problem. They sent me another phone which has a 100% battery. So far this phone has been perfect and I haven't had any issues with it. I also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new. Hopefully this one will hold out.Moral to the story, if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an Amazon renewed phone... don't hesitate, don't take chances... get them to make it right. Some of us are more picky than others, but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery. It is going to be very difficult to find a perfect condition used phone, so you have to pick what you care about most. Good luck!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The phone when inspected by Apple proved to be up to par less the 60% capacity battery.  Never was able to obtain a phone number for Olympic Wireless and the number given me by Amazon turned out to be a newspaper office.  The ask me to call 360-385-2900.  The internet page gave me the options for Olympic Wireless which could not solve my problem.  I need the phone and did not want to go through the hassle of removing all my information to return it for credit from Amazon.  I purchased a new battery installed by Apple for $50.00.  I will not make the mistake of not checking the battery before loading all my information again.  Made the phone a little more expensive but solved my problem.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The only thing that is bad is the mic doesn’t work at all because all you can here is static but other then I’m very happy about the phone.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"Looked great and performed well during use. Unfortunately, phone reported 80% battery health, while actual battery life was terrible. 45 minutes of talk and phone went from 100% to 3%."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The phone is otherwise pristine (at least so far) but the battery is an issue since <80% is where you begin to see the phone throttled and mine is at 79%. They should have never sold this because 79% doesn't cut it and is below their guarantee. Bit shady.  I've got an email into the seller to see what can be done. I can get the battery replaced at Apple but that is an extra $50, or replace it myself by I'm sure that will void seller's the warranty.  Will report after customer service. Just a heads up but the seller's approval rating is very low. I wished I looked at that first. Might have been better off spending an extra $20 for a more reputable seller."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The phone is over all nice. However, I ordered the excellent condition IPhone 7 128gb which unfortunately it’s NOT excellent. There were MASSIVE amounts of dings & scratches all over the sides & back. The paint is badly scratched . They aren’t extremely noticeable unless you look for them because I put a case on it. However, when I ordered excellent I expected excellent . With the price, I should have gotten what I paid for & unfortunately I did not.! There are NO scratches on the front where the screen is or on the camera but it’s the principle. Battery life is at 84% . My husband will make due! Thanks .!"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,The battery came at 80 percent health but the phone dies so much faster than my old iPhone 7. Also the phone was dirty when it arrived. It was really easy to clean so I don’t know why they didn’t do that before shipping. The screen protector came with it but has a little chip. Otherwise works fine.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",3.0,"The screen does have a long and visible scratch. It should be replaced before resale.The qualification ""renewed"" would not correct."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Thought battery would last so much longer but I have to put it on charge after about 11 hours or so.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"This was bought for personal use only. Never give a refurb phone to a child. Personally, I like the phone and would buy another refurb. The only thing I don’t really like is that since the iPhone came out, you loose the 37mm headphone jack in favor of the “dongle”. It’s ok but that’s all it is, just ok. What Apple is wanting you to do is to buy the wireless headphone jacks, but that’s a pricey solution."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"I was very hesitant about getting this phone because of reviews, but so far so good. The only problem is a shaky front camera but as this is so common with later models I’m not too concerned. There was some paint scratches on the back but they are barely viable unless the light catches it in a particular way. Phone came with a charging cord and nothing more, battery life is decent as well as screen response. Highly recommend!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"I’m very much pleased with the condition and functioning of the phone. Not a scratch not anything in the physical composition that shows anything but brand new. Yet, the reason I’m not giving the 5th star is just a small concern regarding my phone gets very hot.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Got this phone yesterday as a backup iPhone to my iPhone 11.  I was pleasantly suprised as the condition of the phone is superb.  Everything works as expected - touch screen, fingerprint reader, etc.  Restored a backup of my iPhone 11 to this phone and transferred the sim card - everything worked perfectly as expected.  The only downside of the phone was the battery came with a 79% maximum capacity so I will probably need to change the battery soon.  All in all for the price I am very happy with this purchase so far."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Even though this is an old model iPhone it still does everything I need a iPhone to do.  Battery life is a bit dated but that is to be expected with older phone models.  Great price

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"The seller was quick and reliable in getting it delivered in a timely manner. Right out the box the phone was in great condition no cracks on the screen or major issues (outside the realm of a few scratches by the charging port, but that’s to be expected for a refurbished). The ONLY thing that prevents this from being a full 5 star (4.5 in my book but Amazon only lets me do whole star counts) is that one of the speaker (left side) isn’t working, but it’s not a deal killer for me since I’m upgrading from a 6s to a 7.Battery health read 100% so that I can tell was for sure replaced which is the SMARTEST move a seller can do when reselling phone, I give that move alone 5 stars all the way, just please mention that on the sales ad to give confidence to buyers so they know they’re getting something that someone actually cares about their customers."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"It’s in decent shape. Only 1 noticeable imperfection that’s covered with a phone case anyway. Week 1 is so far so good.Only con at this point is that the charge can’t last a full day. I’m used to my phone battery lasting 24 hours and I’m lucky if this phone makes it to bedtime. Even on days I work the battery needs charged by the 10 hour mark on my day. Which is a fair amount of time if I was actually using my phone actively, but active days require I charge it half through my day."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"The overall experience went well with buying a renewed iPhone 7 from Amazon.  The phone was packaged well in bubble wrap and had the peel plastic on both sides of the phone.  Cosmetically, it looked brand new.  No scratches, dings, or scrapes that I could see.  Phone was completely wiped and powered right up.  I changed it in the evening.  When it got to 100%, I pulled it off the charger and closed it.  The next morning, my wife picked it up and noticed the charge was at 84% already.  After an hour, she did just a couple of things on it and it was at 75%.  At that point, it was obvious that the battery was never replaced.  Instead of sending the phone back and having Amazon fix it or replace the battery, we just decided to go to a local Batteries + and have the battery replaced.  Phone is good now and like new.  Part of renewing a phone is replacing a battery.  Just understand if you buy a renewed phone from Amazon, it's likely that it might have the old battery in it and you might have to replace it.  Removed one star for that.  Thought about removing 2 stars but the overall experience was nice."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Phone came with a charger that didn’t work.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Nice phone. Fantastic cosmetic condition.Battery was less than 50%. Advertisement guarantees 80%. They offered to take it back, but they would send something similar as a replacement. Just expect to replace battery immediately"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"The iPhone I received was almost, almost mint. I couldn't find a scratch on it, on either the LCD or the body itself. The only negative I could find was the battery capacity. It was less than 80%. With data on, the phone wouldn't last a day. You're lucky to make it to 5pm. Replacing the battery is a necessity. Which I did a week later. Now this iPhone 7 feels and works like brand new. This is an inexpensive way of recycling 3-4 year old tech. And the size is just perfect for one-handed use."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Have had it for about a week now, and no problems. Came with 91% battery capacity which was expected. No aftermarket parts that I could tell. Screen looks good. Only complaint was that there was some light paint dust on the back but it is purely cosmetic. I’ll update at month one! 90 day warranty is a nice factor. I was hesitant to buy when I read some of these reviews, but I seem to have gotten it good. So that is possible if you are considering buying. If you don’t like it, then you’ve got 90 days. There you go bud."

My son is having problems with this phone. When it's off it connect to wi-fi automatically which messes it up even worse. The phone drains his battery quicker now. Before the year is out i might have to get him a new one.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,The phone was great! I didn’t get a chance to get it turned on because soon after using it the phone kept saying it was too hot and needed to cool down before using it again.

I had to remove SIM card and reinsert and it worked fine for a few days and get the notification again. The phone had current update, but every few days would get notification. Other than that, phone performed great. Was able to send back and got a new phone with no issues. Not a bad review just a bad phone."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"The phone is well worth the cost.The only problem I am having is the battery weakens very quickly and must be recharged after few hours. I have a new battery coming from Amazon tomorrow and am hopeful that I will have the skills required to do the work. The battery comes with tools and instructions and I worked for 25 years doing electronic and mechanical tasks,so good luck to me.I have seen reviews where people have said it can't be done and also that the phone would not work with Verizon. I put my old phone chip in and followed the directions on Verizon's website and I can attest that it most surely does work with Verizon."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Used iPhone 7: These devices are so sophisticated someone could probably run a small country with one. If $199 is enough to keep me happy for the next 5 years why would I spend $1100?? The SE 2020 is probably also a good choice at $399 (I did consider SE2020, but still ... $400?)"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,The phone itself is great but the microphone quit working on the one I received. It is December and I ordered the phone in February of the same year. I loved the phone when it was working and the price was good but I guess that is what you get when you order a refurbished phone.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Overall, I am glad I bought this. It's definitely a step up from my iPhone 5s, with a bigger screen and much more storage. It may be my imagination, but the battery life seems not to be impressive at all, but that may be due to the iOS it is running rather than the hardware. Worth the money, and recommended."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Not great. Battery and touch screen not too good.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Purchased this for a friend and as I know it is used it did come with quite a few blemishes, scratches etc. The screen had been replaced as you can see where the home button and also edges don’t completely line up. Making the home button harder to depress. Phone works fairly well other than maybe a small software glitch? Every time she opens her email the phone rings twice like someone is calling but no one is. Took us awhile to figure that one out, lol. Battery and function otherwise is acceptable. A bit over priced for a used phone"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Battery will only hold out for a couple of hours without charging.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,The iPhone physically was in near perfect condition. I did find that the battery health had a maximum percentage of only 80% which can be expected for a used phone but does require it to be on a charger if used even just moderately in order to last a typical 14 hr day

One had a weird thing where when I went to take a picture... the camera was blurry and so were the pics.  The second, although I don’t make a lot of voice calls, from time to time I do, this phone earpiece speaker was so low I couldn’t hold a conversation.  Perfectly imperfect phones."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,Simply replaced my sim card from my i6 and went through startup-downloaded phone backup from icloud.....everything worked great and the phone is real nice.  Well worth the value.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,The phone seems to work pretty well. The negative is the screensaver what is of poor quality and I had to peel it off within the week. Also the calendar had subscriptions for virus removing software which I found a pain to try to remove.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,"Update: I chose the iPhone 7 because of its water resistant properties. But, when this phone was refurbished it must not have been re-sealed, which makes sense in hindsight. My phone landed in a shallow puddle and now it’s dead. I would have purchased a waterproof case had the sales description mentioned it was no longer, at all, water resistant.Update: Update: my return was approved, and I’m happy enough with what I did receive to order again. So I’m leaving a 4 start review, and purchasing a life proof case this time.Original Post: I thought I was taking a gamble when I ordered this phone, I fully expected the price to be too-good-to-be-true, but the phone is PERFECT! The body and glass are flawless and scratch free, which surprised me since refurbs normally have a little wear. The fingerprint reader functions great, the touch screen is perfect. I’m so happy!So far the battery seems good, I’ve been on the phone for about 3 hours with only average decrease.Model and storage space are as advertised (I got the 124GB).Both front and rear cameras work. And data transfer from my old phone went smoothly. I’ll update if anything changes.Seriously great phone! Exceeds expectations."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",4.0,This phone was great for the price!! My only issue is battery life. It's not great. But I'm sure every iPhone user has this issue. And the power button on the side instead of the top. I keep accidentally clicking my phone off while I'm holding it sideways and working or playing a game. But that's a designer issue. This seller sent me a great renewed phone. There's virtually zero damage to the screen and phone itself. The buttons all work with no struggle. This was a fantastic purchase.

It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,the battery life is alright. it says 12 hrs when it really lasts up to 8 but its not a big deal. nice phone.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"Phone arrived UPS 2nd day air and was in perfect condition. Not a blemish on the device anywhere to be found.  Slid my Mint Mobile SIM card in it and it works absolutely perfect thus far.  My only concern is the battery doesn't last as long as my Samsung S6 Active, but that could just be an Apple Iphone thing, as I see extended battery hard cases are a popular item for iphones. The seller was extremely professional and appears to be genuinely interested in customer satisfaction.  That in it self is a commodity I hold in high regard these days."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,Cant believe how cheap I got this iPhone on Amazon. It's my second tiwe buying a 'Renewed' phone off Amazon (my first purchase was a computer). Both are working great!
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"After having some odd results from another site, decided to try out the most trusted platform i know and although it cost a little bit more, this thing is nearly brand new.i almost settled for a piece of junk that was cracked on the back and the camera was busted but the front looked decent enough. ended up having to send that one back since it couldn't make phone calls but this one is absolutely perfect and has literally 0 signs of usage, it's crazy and i love it"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"I’ve had this phone for about 3 months now and it works great.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"Phone was a restored model iPhone 7 bought from Amazon. It works great.Battery came with 80% charge (barely) and deteriorated rapidly. I nursed it along with external battery packs for a few months but when it was down to 50% I broke down and spent the $49.00 bucks and got Apple to give me a new battery. Btw, they recommend changing batteries if it dips below 80%. Which is where I started. Oops."

However, be aware that Amazon reconditioned phones DO NOT come the serial number on the receipt, so you are out of lucky if Apple has an issue with it. They will consider it stolen."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"Great way to update from my older iPhone version without paying the cost of a new item. The phone comes neatly packed (not the original packing, but good enough), and it comes with a battery charger included. The phone looks and performs just like a new item, save for a slightly reduced battery life (it reaches the end of the day with 20-30% battery with normal use). No problem to activate it and use it in Chile after registering the phone IMEI with a local mobile network operator."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,I had issues trying to get the phone the last two days to work with boost mobile. Just a helpful hint I’d have boost mobile they are very picky with what phone you can bring to the company. I switch my line from boost to cricket to be able to use the phone. The seller was super helpful in every step of the way and reply’s super fast!! They offered an exchange and refund if it didn’t work. I’m glad I switched becauseI absolutely love my phone and I even bought one for my mom in gold. She loves it too!

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,I honestly cannot find any defect in this phone. Not even one little scratch. The only thing that tells me it is not brand new is that it didn't come in a standard Apple box. Have had it for almost a month and it seems to be working perfectly.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"I'm very glad I bought this phone.  The condition was great.  I can charge it in a couple hours, and the battery lasts for days.  I was able to take it to AT&T and they put in a sim card and it started right up. it has had no problems.  I learned my lesson about not leaving it charged all night, and letting it run down to 20% or less before recharging it, on my old phone. The phone was like new, and came with a power cord and plug that works.  Next time I need a phone I want to use the same vendor."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, ""battery health"" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice ""Youmaker"" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,Brought this for my mom when it was time to upgrade. She likes iPhone but didn’t have one and the rest of the family does.It’s a nice iPhone without getting too fancy like the newer models. Mom is an older phone user so things like the fingerprint reader helps her with the passwords. The battery life is great. Lasts mom most of the day. The smaller phone size (compared to the 11) is good for her since she has arthritis.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",5.0,"I took a chance with a refurbished phone after looking at prices of new ones and not ready to bite the bullet yet. I couldn't believe how fast the product arrived. I ordered a used iPhone 7 on a Sunday night and received it on the following Tuesday. So far everything has been as advertised, it is in excellent working condition, the phone looks almost brand new and the battery capacity is 81%  I loaded everything from my old phone onto this one from my computer and put my SIM card in it and it was good to go. I'm hoping to get at least a year out of this phone. Time will tell, but I'm happy so far."
