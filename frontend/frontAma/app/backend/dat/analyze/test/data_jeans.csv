"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",You will not be able to use a SIM card with this unless you pay for Apple to install the necessary hardware. I was quoted nearly $300.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Wouldn’t read my T-Mobile SIM card
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","Worked slow, barely charged."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","Will be returning, 73% battery life, very disappointed as Amazon guarantees at least 80%.  Wish this was checked before it was sent out"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Why can’t I get a signal and I am not receiving any calls
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",When we got the phone right from out of the box the charging port is not working properly so that is also the headphone jack in one. We basically can’t use it until I get the charge jack replaced.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","When I ordered the phone, I ordered it for my 4 yr old. When I tell you the battery life was HORRIBLE, it was HORRIBLE!!! I sent the phone back."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",When i got it - first thing i did was try to charge it.Apple logo show up - then goes away again. ... then this repeats ... again and again .. I've tried several times to Restore or Reset the phone - via iTunes - No luck... its just a brick :-(
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",When first turned on the phone it said corrupt battery and when I messaged them about it they got back to me once just asking for certain serial numbers and after I gave them to them they never got back to me and now dealing with a bad battery which is getting to be very frustrating. Don’t purchase from them because they guaranteed about 90% battery but this was way below that and did nothing to help or replace it or anything!
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",What I liked about this phone is the price for $150 not too bad. But I just spent an additional $49 for insurance. The one thing that I was concerned about with this phone is that the seller was not very honest about how many scratches were in back of the phone. Good thing for having a case. We will never see those scratches. Returned phone software didn’t work.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",We have had the phones (I bought two of them) for a couple weeks. The first phone stopped working within the first week. The second all of a sudden stopped today. Won’t turn on nothing. So $300 wasted and now I have to buy new phones. I am beyond mad at this point.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Was a gift to my granddaughter. She did not have this iPhone 6 months before it stopped working. Phone will not charge anymore.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","Unfortunately I bought this phone in September and at the beginning of January it did not pick up the network again, it did not allow me to update it, I bought the simcard 3 times and nothing ... currently I changed companies thinking that it was the operator and today that I try it I get no it serves!! I am so sad and disappointed because I thought that because I bought it on Amazon it would last longer, unfortunately it does not work!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This was scam. everything looked good at first. We got an iphone 7 128gb and compatible with verizon. However, It was not compatible with verizon at all. Now i am hoping to get a refund. I do't think they will give it to me though. So please save yourself the trouble and shop elsewhere."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This was a foreign phone. Not compatible with the cell system in the United States. It probably would’ve worked perfectly in Europe.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone was purchased for my grandson and after only one week the charger end broke. I tried charging it with my IPhone charger and it wouldn’t charge. The phone quit charging even before the charger end broke. How do I return this for a refund?
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","this phone was not unlocked, so what's the point?"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This phone was great for a couple of months.  Then, one evening the phone started shutting off/restarting independently.  I looked up the problem on the internet and came to the conclusion it was the battery.  I took it to the local computer store and ordered a new battery.  The technician told me the protective plate that holds down the battery was missing and whoever refurbished this phone put a piece of tape inside the phone.  Also, it came with a screen protector on it.  The case I put on the phone won’t fit with this protector so I took it off.  The technician told me the screen was warped when he put the new battery in it.  I will never buy another refurbished phone!!!!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone was completely locked. Couldn’t figure out the carrier for it!
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This phone was actually not fully unlocked, it was not compatible with Verizon. I have requested an exchange, in hopes that this was just a glitch."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone is very bad and healthy battery no good and lot of scratches noooooo gooooooooddd
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone has absolutely no battery life
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This phone does not work. It’s great to watch movies or send texts but as a phone call, it does not work you cannot hear sound over it whenever anyone calls they can’t hear me and I can’t hear them. Definitely not a well refurbished phone. I would not buy from this vendor."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone did not work!It doesn’t connect to our phone SIM card and can only be on WiFi. It was also broken at opening where the SIM card goes in. I am extremely disappointed!!
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone came earlier then expected.. but in checking I noticed that the charging port was not working... I contacted the seller and tried all they told me to get the charging port up and running but it’s still not working I won’t recommend anyone  to buy this product..... it’s a waste of money and waste of time
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This is not the first renewed phone I have purchased from amazon and typically they are like brand new phones with less battery life but for some reason this particular phone I am having all kinds of problems. From the first seller I chose the phone I received looked brand new but had a dreadful battery under the advertised 80 percent and needed to be replaced so I sent that one back and ordered another one from another seller. This second phone has decent battery life but looks like complete and utter crap. The casing is scuffed and pitted everywhere and the screen is horribly scratched. If you are going to buy a renewed phone I would try a newer product.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This is my first time leaving this kind of review but I don't want others to have the same experience. The phone would not stay charge and the home button is damaged.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This is bad quality phone doesn’t work to connect with another company and it’s battery life is 81 %
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This is a useless phone now thanks to ios

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",These phones suck I have bought a total 4 phones and they all go out face battery doesn’t last long does not hold a charge screen glitches and randomly freezes up I do not recommend
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The T Mobile iPhone 7 that I purchased from this company turns on and charges, but could never be activated on my T Mobile plan. After three months of trying, going to T Mobile stores in Vermont, Massachusetts and New York, it could never be activated for data use. It is basically, an I Pod. After reaching out to the company about it, they reassured me the phone was fine. It isn’t. I missed the return window by a few days; they said they would not do anything to assist me with a refund or exchange. I suggest finding another way to buy a used phone. Don’t use this seller."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The stop working in 2 weeks
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The sim tray was defective and the supplier/Amazon did nothing to help .
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The seller I bought from (Electronic Deals) sent me a phone with 69% battery health.  Even though the Amazon description clearly says 80% or above.  The health dropped to 68% the next day, and then wouldn't even hold a charge.  If they're not even simply checking if a number in the settings is above 80% (a simple yes or no), then you have to wonder if they're really inspecting these at all.  These phones are good prices and it's easy to return them, but still annoying for it to be sent without passing a simple inspection check and potentially leave people without a phone another few days while they return and wait for a new one.  I highly recommend everyone to check the battery health right when you receive the phone before you waste your time installing stuff/setting up."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The product worked only told slightly outside return date.  My product was returnable til 06/07/21. Last week 07/15/21 my phone was unable to connect to my data any longer. I found this out to be a common problem with the 7’s.  We took it in and because the original purchase date of phone was 2016 it fell outside of apples warranty for the issue (4yrs). And also I’m 5 weeks outsid Amazon’s warranty.  So now I have a phone they can only be used on WiFi. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone would not work it would not get out of down loading iso it wouldn’t allow me to put my phone info on it just kept downloading but never would fully load
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The phone works but there's a blotch on the screen, the charger cable didn't work at all even though it looked brand new, the screen vibrates at times, and the feature where you touch a misspelled word and correct suggests pos up doesn't work at all.It's too bad because I had a good experience with a refurbished phone in the past but this one is junk."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone was ordered to work with AT&T. They can not connect it to work because this company has a hold on it and want it back before they refund me. Its been a very poor experience with this company.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone arrives with a bad battery in it I called the company and they’re clearly able to tell me from the serial number that they knew it had a bad battery so why was it sent to me in the first place?!?! their solution to this is for me to pay all of this money to get the problem solved and fixed ridiculous company don’t even waste given them your money just buy a product new or go elsewhere

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The day I received the phone I realized the camera’s didn’t work I was willing to look past that issue until I then noticed the phone wouldn’t stay charged for more than an  hour. I sent the phone back because they were supposed to send a replacement I have not received a replacement replacement or my money back and have not heard from anyone!

The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Phone worked ok but the battery wouldn't last over 4 hours or less with use they must have forgotten to refurbished it.  Always nervous about buying refurbished electronics because there is almost always a  reason it was refurbished there's no way to know if it was just a trade in for a newer phone or because it wasn't working.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured ""why not?"". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the ""geniuses"" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",I'm very frustrated with my iphone. First time that I try to use the battery was totally discharged and not do appears any information at the screen. I bought this product and I sent to Brazil to sell to another person.

The battery was as bad as the battery in the phone I was trying to replace. When all is said and done, I will return one phone and my wife will have returned two. We’re getting iPhones from eBay. Every refurbished iPhone we’ve received there has been good. I wanted to try something different this time around but I regret it. Never again."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","I was unaware when I bought this phone that Apple had recalled all IPhone 7s for a “no service” error. Unfortunately, I encountered this error and was unable to connect it to service which completely defeated the point of me buying it. I ended up having to buy an iPhone 11 from Walmart, which costs a little more than this phone did. I recommend choosing a different phone as this was most definitely not worth the money or time I spent trying to set it up."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","I received the iPhone 7 at the end of January 2021.  Forty-five days after the 90-day return window had had expired the phone started crashing constantly and wouldn't work at all unless it was plugged in.  I tried all of the troubleshooting tips I found online to no avail.The same day, I noticed that the screen was bowing away from the case and I was not able to push it back together.  I took the phone apart and found that the battery was swollen.  When I looked into this I found that is can be extremely dangerous due to outgassing and risk of fire.  When I contacted Kiss Electronics they refused to offer any assistance whatsoever because I was outside the 90-day window.Customer service is a choice.  There are always options and ways a seller can accommodate and assist their customers. Kiss Electronics not only sent me phone with a dangerously defective battery, they offered no assistance whatsoever to rectify the situation.I would not recommend buying from them."

There is supposed to be a 90 day warranty and they are not honoring it. I went to Apple and they told me that they are not able to fix because it is out of warranty with them. They even said i need to get a refund or replacement because the company sold me a phone with a known issue. And again they are Refusing to honor warranty or anything. There is no damage to the phone at all.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",I can’t give this zero stars unfortunately.  Phone came and doesn’t work.  It tried to update for 48 hours and when reset wouldn’t turn on past the Apple logo.  I needed this phone ASAP as the person it was going to needs it for work.  Very very discouraged and unhappy with this seller.  I guess we will be spending more and going with a different seller.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",I can hardly hear anyone who calls me. I have tried to contact the seller twice and never responded back!
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","I bought this phone for my husband because of the storage and its promise to be ""like new"". When we first received the phone, we were annoyed to find that the front camera didn't work and the battery only lasted an hour or two before dying. After 4 months of owning the phone, it completely stopped working. Would not receive or make calls and couldn't send texts unless connected to wifi. We took to the Apple store and they said that this model was discontinued because of this issue, and there was nothing they could do. My husband ended up having to buy a completely new phone. I wouldn't purchase from this seller as it was promised to be ""like new"" and it obviously was not."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",I bought this for my mom for mother’s day. She just opened it to connect service. She can hardly hear the other person on the line. The speaker for phone calls is junk. Her fault for not connecting it sooner but the seller could stand behind their product. They refuse to exchange phone. I do not recommend buying from someone unwilling to exchange a faulty product.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Horrible. Stopped working when we needed to update.  To it to geeksquad they had to reset it and now it won't work at all. Only got to use it a month maybe. And was too late on returning it.

It tells me I have no service and have to turn on airplane mode to get it to turn off. Problem is that I usually plug it in and start driving so then I just end up driving without music or directions for awhile until I can get to a red light and do that.The phone was nice when I got it and isn’t chipped or cracked or anything, I think buying refurbished iPhones might be a bad idea but idk you do you yanno"

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","At first the phone looked brand new, battery life capacity in health said 100%. However after 2 days of using it began restarting the phone every 5 minutes itself and once that happened the battery never held would go from 19% to 2% immediately and it would never charge past 29%. At first I thought needed to update and restart phone and maybe different charger so I used an actual iPhone charger, updated it and restarted it. It did not help. However the phone looked brand new. I wish this device would have worked out :("
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","As soon as I turned the phone on, it started heating up rapidly from within. In less than 5 minutes I couldn’t even hold it.

I bought it in April at the beginning of the pandemic with very limited choices to buy a phone and my old phone was not working. I contacted the seller letting them know how the packaging was in case of problems later with no response. I have had many problems with the phone. I contacted the seller again with no response. I would not recommend this seller,"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","When I received this phone, the first thing I noticed is that the speaker was really low. I was not able to hear phone calls very well.

In the meantime, I allowed her to use it like a tablet.  7 months later, when we went to get it activated it was not fully unlocked, and she could not get service on it.  I sure wish we would have checked it sooner.  The seller would only give 50% back at that point if we returned the phone, charger and box."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","We have already had to spend $85 to replace the main screen componant, so I can't give this phone a good rating."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",Way to many scratches and it gets hot very quick. I understand normal wear and tear but this one is just way out of line.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This was a great phone and all, but once I got outside of the 90-day protection period I noticed a few problems coming gout of the woodwork. First the battery started not charging slower and with a little less time on a full battery, which I honestly thought would happen earlier on. However that hasn't been the only problem, now it makes a very loud sounds middle of calls and the in-call speaker randomly emits extremely loud burst of static, screechings, and whistles that have left my ear ringing and unable to finish calls. If its not making those sounds in my ear, it usually doesn't make any at all. My mic picks up my voice, but I can't hear anything, not even on speakerphone.This may have been a bad on out of the batch, but if you have money to buy something better I'd say to consider it. Unless you want to use it as an ""Ipod""."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This phone, after a year, started having problems. The camera doesn’t focus well anymore and it is starting to have image retention. Be careful buying! Battery life is starting to dwindle too."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","This phone will cost at least $50 more than it appears to. After less than 4 months, the battery is “significantly degraded”. The battery was charging and losing power very quickly. I found out why a few weeks after the Amazon 90-day return expired. It is not covered by an Apple warranty either. Amazon must have known this when they sent me the phone."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone was purchased a couple of months ago and went out right away.  We recovered it now it is totally out and Apple said on recall due to malfunction.  Trying to get it replaced.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card.

Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The seller did not respond to the phone number or email included on the card that came with the phone. We have had troubles with the battery not holding a charge, it needs to be plugged in all the time. It also had troubles with the screen which appear to be a little bit improved. We need the seller to respond or we will just update this review to a one star."

I had it at 100% and sitting on a desk not being used, and it was down to 3% by 4:30pm. I reached out to seller and asked if he could send another one so my kid wasn't phoneless and then when I got the new one, return the original and if it wasn't returned, he could charge for both. Never heard back."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone will randomly die after being charged.

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone looks new and there's no scratches unlike other people comment but the thing is that when I charge the phone it's getting hot and the battery don't last. I just used it for like 10-15 mins and it's already half of the battery life and it's getting hotter and hotter when you used it. I returned it anyways coz I'm afraid that the phone might explode while I used it or I charge it. I'm soooo disappointed coz this is my first iphone and also this is the first time I ordered through online. Lesson learned but its a great experience though. I hope this will help those people who's thinking of buying a refurbished phone. My advise is that always rethink coz not everyone is lucky to get a good phone like the other says in the comment.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed."

"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The phone in itself looked GREAT, and worked well, however the battery life was severely lacking. Dying every two hours.

The company was really great and fast about giving a refund!"
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked",The phone has really really poor battery performance. I’ve never ha this issue with a renewed item before.
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The phone had a bad battery that would only last for about 4 hours. Because I was in a situation where I couldn’t wait for a return, I had to get the battery replaced at my expense. When the technician opened the phone there was clear damage to components on the inside. One component looked like it came out of a phone that had a battery fire. If I wasn’t in a pinch I would have returned it in a heartbeat."
"(Refurbished) Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked","The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me."
