# Enhancing Product Review Insights with OpenAI API

## Overview
Leveraging OpenAI's advanced NLP capabilities, this project aims to automate the extraction and analysis of product review content, focusing initially on the camera category. Our approach encompasses two primary pipelines: a summarization pipeline and an aspect-based evaluation pipeline, designed to provide concise summaries and detailed aspect analysis of product reviews, respectively. This initiative seeks to transform unstructured review data into structured insights, aiding both consumers and businesses in making informed decisions.
